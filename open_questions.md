# Questions for Docker
- How do we deploy/redeploy docker? (snapshotting, etc…)
- How do we get stuff (files/streaming logs/etc…) out of a container
- Docker images for arbitrary OSes?
- Garbage collection?

# Questions for Ourselves
- Should users always upload everything?  Or are we going to allow this delta-upload thing anymore?
